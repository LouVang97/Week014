# Weekly Summary

I tried to download nginx instead of using apache which may have caused the outage (sorry!!). Our team is continually running into the same problem.
Our php test file is not working. I have updated the php7.0 to php7.2 with failed results.
Yasir and I have been trying mutliple ways to fix php, but are still running into walls.
This next week, I will finish documenting protocols and continuing to research and deploy mediawiki.
